While it's honest to admit when you don't know something, it's important to prepare basic comparisons between commonly used languages in your field. There were no strengths demonstrated in terms of technical content, relevance, or clarity. To improve, the candidate should study the main differences such as syntax, interoperability, null safety, and Android-specific features in Kotlin versus Java.

    "userAnswer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nA broad field in computer science that aims to build systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.\n\nIncludes reasoning, decision-making, natural language understanding, perception, and problem-solving.\n\nMachine Learning is one of the methods used in AI.\n\nMachine Learning (ML)\n\nA subset of AI.\n\nFocuses on creating algorithms that allow systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.\n\nExample: training a model to recognize spam emails by learning patterns from past data.",
    "feedback": "The answer clearly distinguishes between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), correctly identifying AI as a broader field and ML as a subset focused on learning from data. The explanation touches on key aspects of AI (such as reasoning and perception) and ML (algorithms, data-driven improvement), and the inclusion of a practical example for ML (spam detection) adds value. The response is well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. However, the answer could be improved by briefly clarifying that not all AI systems use ML—some use rule-based or symbolic approaches—and by providing a short example of AI that does not use ML. Adding a closing summary sentence would also help reinforce the main points.",
